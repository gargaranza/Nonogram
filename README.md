# Nonogram
Nonogram solver

# How it works
Go to the end of Nonogram.py and enter the columns and lines on the C and L variables like the exemple.
Run and see the Nonogram solved on the terminal.

# Limits
It depends on the power of the machine but it can solve a 25x25 in 10 seconds and a 40x40 is too long
